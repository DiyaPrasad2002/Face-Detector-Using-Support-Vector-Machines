# Face Detector Using Support Vector Machines

### Project Overview
This repository consists of all required files and codes that were used for developing a model that is able to classify the images of 4 Indian actors. The model is basically an SVM based classifier. The data used for training and testing were obtained from kaggle. The datasets are also provided as zip files.

The dataset consists of 108 testing and 429 training images. This is a multiclass classification problem, with 4 different classes involved. 

### Model Info.
It is to note that the FaceDetector notebook consists of the model without PCA performed on the dataset, however, the other notebook (FaceDetectorWithPCA) is the one with PCA performed and hence is a way better performer than the first one.
